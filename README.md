# 💼 Salary Prediction System 💰

## 📋 Description
The **Salary Prediction System** is a machine learning-based project designed to predict salaries based on experience and other relevant factors. This project marks my **first machine learning model**! It is implemented on **Google Colab** and deployed using **PythonAnywhere** for easy access.

## 🚀 Features
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Model**: Implements a simple yet effective **Linear Regression** model.
- 🌟 **Interactive User Interface**: Allows users to input experience levels and get predicted salaries.
- 📊 **Real-Time Prediction**: Instantly displays prediction results.

## 🎯 Dataset
The dataset consists of experience levels and corresponding salaries. The model is trained to find patterns in this data and make predictions.

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PRINCERAHUL1/Salary-Prediction-System.git
   cd Salary-Prediction-System
   ```
2. Run the application on Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   Salary_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

## 📥 Usage
1. Input experience level through the system's interface.
2. The model processes the input data and provides a predicted salary.

## 🧪 Model Training
- The machine learning model was trained using the **Scikit-learn** library.
- The model made with **Linear Regression** ml algorithm.

## 📊 Results
- Model Accuracy: **High correlation with real salary data**
- Visualized predictions using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
